## Reporting a Vulnerability

I am currently working on early versions of the project but have not yet launched a ready-to-use release version of the project.

Report a vulnerability
If you find a security vulnerability in EduFlow, please report it by opening an issue or by contacting abdulvosidfoziljonov2@gmail.com directly.

Report via GitHub Issues: Submit a Security Issue

Response Time: We aim to respond to all security reports within 48 hours.

Process:

Once your report is received, we will review and investigate the issue.

If accepted, we will work on a fix and keep you informed of the progress.

If rejected (e.g. not a vulnerability or not reviewed), we will explain the reason.

Please try not to disclose security vulnerabilities until we have fixed them.
Your help in making EduFlow more secure is greatly appreciated! ðŸš€
